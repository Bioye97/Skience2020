    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "With the adjoint method the model derivatives of an objective function can be exactly calculated where the objective function quantifies the misfit between observed and synthetic data sets. Hence, it is a useful tool for inverse problems as one tries to find the model that minimizes the objective function. \n",
    "If it is possible to model the physical problem with a partial differential equation (e.g. wave equation), the model derivatives of the objective function can be computed by solving the forward problem twice. Derivations expanding the volume of this notebook can be found in _Fichtner et al._ (2006a).\n",
